# Secure-Password-Manager
Password Storage center

1. Password Storage
    Will use a centralized server to store all the passwords for all users
    The users will first register themselves with the server setting their username and password 
    They will then enter their passwords which will be stored after being hashed and salted for safe storage 
    They will only be able to be accessed after successful login 
2. User Access over network
    Not exactly sure how this will look but there will be some interface that allows the user to log in and access their passwords
    All network traffic will use PGP combined with digital certificates to ensure security
